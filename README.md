# OPM
A collection of Optimization Problems in Matlab

OPM is a small collection of CUTEst unconstrained and bound-constrained nonlinear
optimization problems, which can be used in Matlab for testing optimization algorithms
directly (i.e. without installing additional software).

The problems are individualy available in the directory "problems".

It is possible to upload all problems at once as "OPM.tar.gz".
